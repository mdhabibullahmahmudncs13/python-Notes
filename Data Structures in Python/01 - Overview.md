# Overview

← [[Data Structures in Python]] | Next: [[02 - Basic Python]] →

## Purpose of This Book

This book is designed to cover a lot of ground quickly, **without taking shortcuts**.

### What This Means
- **Concepts are motivated** and start with simple examples
- **Ideas follow the problems**
- **Abstractions follow concrete instances**

### What This Does NOT Mean
- **Not comprehensive** - doesn't cover all data structures or all Python details
- **Focused approach** - introduces minimum necessary knowledge to make interesting programs and learn useful concepts

## Topics Covered

The book integrates multiple important concepts:

1. **Data Structures** - Main organizing principle (see chapter titles in [[Data Structures in Python]])
2. **Problem Solving Strategies** - Introduced throughout (e.g., [[09 - Recursion]], [[10 - Dynamic Programming]])
3. **Advanced Python** - Progressively introduced (see [[02 - Basic Python]], [[03 - Object-Oriented Programming]])
4. **Object-Oriented Design** - Design principles and patterns
5. **Testing Methodologies** - See [[04 - Testing]]

## Organization

### Simple Part
Overall sequencing motivated by **data structuring problems**

### Complex Part
Many concepts introduced **bit by bit** in a logical, incremental way:
- Problem solving strategies
- More advanced Python features
- Object-oriented design principles  
- Testing methodologies

## How to Use This Book

> [!important]
> This book is **not meant to be a reference**. It is meant to be **worked through from beginning to end**.

Many topics were intentionally left out to make it possible to complete in a single semester course.

## Related Topics

- Start learning with [[02 - Basic Python]]
- Understanding [[03 - Object-Oriented Programming]] principles
- Learn about [[04 - Testing]] methodologies
- Study [[05 - Running Time Analysis]] for efficiency

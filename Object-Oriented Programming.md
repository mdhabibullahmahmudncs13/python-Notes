# Object-Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects that contain data and code.

**Deep Dive:** See [[Data Structures in Python/03 - Object-Oriented Programming|OOP in Data Structures]] for design principles, inheritance vs composition, and duck typing

## Topics

- [[Python OOP Concepts]] - Core OOP principles
- [[Python Classes and Objects]] - Creating classes and objects
- [[Python Inheritance]] - Inherit from parent classes
- [[Python Polymorphism]] - Same interface, different implementations
- [[Python Encapsulation]] - Hide internal details

## Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundle data and methods together
2. **Inheritance**: Create new classes from existing ones
3. **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types through same interface
4. **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details
